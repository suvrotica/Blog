      <p class="col-span-2">Although flippant, this blog is a scratchpad of thoughts, a much-sought-after extension of my
	embarrassing tangle of nerves, unrelated fancies and figments strewn around and rattling loose in
	it, collectibles from the waste basket scraps that should have seen a shredder, or, somewhat more
	crudely, everything about anything. I'm not a prisoner to the usual boundaries that limit most
	people, and I wanted a place where the diarist in me could jot down the wanderings of his
	profligately traveling mind and not feel unwelcome. I presume I would leave the world richer in
	nonsense than anything of substance. But here I explore, when I still can, the vast and forbidden
	realms of human feats and foibles, fucks and farts, feces and fraternities. So whether you're a
	seasoned simulationist or a curious commoner, an android or an amateur, a ponderer or a
	pragmatist, join me in the infinite mosaic of collective nonsense we can explore.</p>
